Data Structures and Algorithms Projects (CSE 310)
This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (CSE 310) projects written in C++. The projects focus on key concepts such as linked lists, priority queues, memory management, modular design, command-line arguments, file I/O, and shortest path algorithms.

Project Contents:
ðŸ“‚ PJ1: Linked Lists, Command Line Arguments, File I/O, Memory Management
ðŸ“‚ PJ2: Priority Queues, Min-Heaps, Heapify Operations
ðŸ“‚ PJ3: Graph Algorithms, Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path, Min-Heap, Stack
Each project follows a modular design approach, using separate header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files. The projects were developed and tested on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) using the g++ compiler and Makefile.
